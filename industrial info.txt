        recieveables turnover = revenue / accounts recieveable
        asset turnover = renvenue / total assets
        payables turnover  = cost of goods sold / account payable
    cash conversion cycle = days sales of inventory + days sales outstanding + days payable outstanding
        DSI = (inventory / cost of goods sold) * 365
        DSO = (accounts receivale / revenue) * 365
        DPO = (accounts payable / cost of goods sold) * 365

            Debt service coverage ratio DSCR = EBITDA / total debt service
Price ratios
    Earnings ratios
        earnings per share = net profit (- preferred dividends) / common shares outstanding
        P/E price to earnings ratio = share price / earnings per share
        PEG price / earnings-to-growth ratio = P/E / EPS growth (expected earnings per share)
    dividend ratios
        DPS dividends per share = dividends paid (- special dividends) / common share outstanding
        dividend yield = dividends per share / share price
        dividend payout = divdendds paid / net profit
Market Capitalization = number of shares outstanding * current market share price


Valuation methods

CAPM - Capital asset pricing model - expected return of investment
 - risk free rate (10-year treasury note)
 - Beta: relationship between market and investment (market has 1.0)
 - expected return of market (historical, say 9%)

WACC - weighted average cost of capital
    calculates cost of capital of a Company
        cost of debt / preferred shares / equity

 
DCF - discounted cash flow model
